# Helion v2 — Component Design

Detailed internals for each system component. For the high-level architecture,
see [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

## 1. Coordinator

The coordinator is the single control-plane process.

**Node registry.** Maintains the authoritative list of known nodes, their certificates,
health status, and current load. Persisted in BadgerDB; each heartbeat updates a TTL-keyed
record under `nodes/`.

**Scheduler.** Selects a target node for each incoming job. Policies are pluggable behind
an interface:
- `roundrobin` — cycles through healthy nodes using `atomic.Int64` (v1 race fixed)
- `least` — picks the node with the fewest running jobs

**Job lifecycle.** Tracks every job through a strict state machine:

```
pending → dispatching → running → completed
                                → failed
                                → lost
```

All transitions are persisted atomically and written to the audit log.

**Dispatch loop.** Periodically polls the job store for pending jobs and dispatches them
to healthy nodes. Uses the scheduler to pick a target node, transitions the job to
`dispatching`, then sends it via gRPC to the node agent. On dispatch failure the job is
marked `failed`; on success the node takes ownership and reports back via `ReportResult`.

**Certificate Authority.** Issues per-node X.509 certificates on first registration using
ML-DSA (Dilithium-3) in hybrid mode with ECDSA. Acts as the cluster's internal CA. The
signed certificate is returned in the `RegisterResponse` so the node can present it on
its own gRPC server — this allows the coordinator to verify node certs during dispatch.

**REST/WebSocket API.** Serves the Angular dashboard and `helion-run` CLI. All endpoints
except `/healthz`, `/readyz`, and `/metrics` require a valid JWT. Admin-only endpoints
(`/admin/...`) additionally require `role: admin` in the token claims.

**Certificate pinning.** On first registration the coordinator records the SHA-256
fingerprint of the node's DER certificate. Subsequent registrations with a different
certificate are rejected unless the node goes through a full revoke → re-register cycle.

**Stream revocation.** When a node is revoked, its active heartbeat gRPC stream is
closed immediately via a done channel, eliminating the window between revocation and
the next heartbeat timeout.

**Crash recovery.** On startup, reads BadgerDB, identifies non-terminal jobs, waits 15 s
(configurable grace period) for nodes to re-register, then dispatches recovered jobs.

**Workflow / DAG engine.** Supports multi-job workflows with dependency-driven execution.

- **DAG validation.** On submission, validates the job graph using Kahn's algorithm for
  cycle detection. Rejects duplicate names, unknown references, and self-dependencies.
- **Job materialisation.** `WorkflowStore.Start()` creates a real `Job` in the `JobStore`
  for each workflow step (ID = `{workflow_id}/{job_name}`). Root jobs (no `depends_on`)
  enter the pending queue immediately.
- **Dependency gating.** The dispatch loop builds an eligible set each tick by checking
  whether all upstream dependencies have reached a satisfying terminal state. Three
  conditions control eligibility: `on_success` (default), `on_failure`, `on_complete`.
- **Cascading failure.** When a job fails and downstream dependents require `on_success`,
  they are automatically marked `lost` with a descriptive reason.
- **Workflow completion.** When all jobs in a workflow reach a terminal state, the workflow
  is marked `completed` (all succeeded) or `failed` (any failed/timed out/lost).
- **Cancellation.** `DELETE /workflows/{id}` marks all non-terminal jobs as `lost` and
  transitions the workflow to `cancelled`.

File layout:
```
workflow.go           — errors, interfaces, WorkflowStore type
workflow_submit.go    — Submit, Start
workflow_lifecycle.go — EligibleJobs, OnJobCompleted, Cancel
workflow_read.go      — Get, List, RunningWorkflowIDs, Restore
dag.go                — ValidateDAG, TopologicalSort, Descendants, RootJobs
```

## 2. Node agent

Each node agent is a long-lived process on a worker host.

- **Self-registration.** Contacts the coordinator via gRPC on startup, presents its
  certificate, and registers. If no certificate exists, initiates the issuance flow.
- **Heartbeat.** Maintains a bidi-streaming gRPC call to the coordinator at a configurable
  interval (default 10 s). The coordinator does not poll — it passively monitors the stream.
- **Job execution.** Receives dispatch RPCs, hands off to the runtime layer, streams log
  chunks back to the coordinator in real time.
- **Local metrics.** Exposes a `/metrics` endpoint in Prometheus text format.

---

## 3. Runtime interface

The runtime is isolated from the agent behind a Go interface:

```go
type Runtime interface {
    Run(ctx context.Context, job Job, logWriter io.Writer) error
    Kill(jobID string) error
    Status(jobID string) (JobStatus, error)
}
```

**GoRuntime** (current default) — uses Linux namespaces (UTS, PID, MNT) gated behind a
privilege check. Falls back to a plain subprocess when `HELION_ALLOW_ISOLATION=false`.

**RustRuntime** — communicates with the `helion-runtime` Rust binary over a Unix
domain socket using protobuf-framed messages. Adds cgroup v2 resource limits and
seccomp-bpf syscall filtering. Enabled by setting `HELION_RUNTIME_SOCKET`.

The selector logic:

```
HELION_RUNTIME_SOCKET set + socket reachable  → RustRuntime
otherwise                                      → GoRuntime
```
